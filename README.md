# Sentiment Analyzer

Ternary classification problem. Dataset was a set of Yelp! reviews in three classes: positive, negative and neutral. My team was ranked 13th in the leaderboard with an accuracy of 87.7%. We used a variety of Deep learning techniques such as CNNs and RNNs as well as simpler techniques such as Naive Bayes'. The best accuracy was produced by a CNN approach while Naive Bayes' finished a close second.
